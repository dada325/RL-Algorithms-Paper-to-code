Please note that this repo is a collection of algorithms I implemented and tested out of my own interest. But I think it could be helpful to share it with others and I'm expecting useful discussions on my implementations. I found that there are no Implementation for JAX, so I think maybe it is challging to make my own one. The repo is presented in a way more like a tutorial and maybe the code is not that clean as I might refactor the code a couple of times.
